This internal-use Python application streamlines reconciliation of hospital Excel records with Tableau census data. It connects securely to Tableau, fetches patient encounter details, and applies automated matching and validation rules to uploaded Excel files â€” generating a reconciled output with status flags, calculated IDs, and charge code evaluations.
